h2. Hair login can remember the password

If it's okay fro you to be insecure you can tell hair to remember passwords for different docbases. Edit the file plugins/hair.dctm_gui/hair_connect.ini and insert the following new line:

bc. unsecure=1

Restart hair. It will now remember the secrets. Remove this file to remove all stored passwords.

h2. Profiles for different docbases

You can create a profile for each of your docbases. In the profile you can store some basic things like a background color. In this way you can easily recognice wich docbase you are editing. I prefer to mark productive docbases wit ha red label.

For this go into the directory plugins/hair.dctm_gui/dock end create a file with the following pattern:

bc. profile_<docbase name>@<host name>_<port - 1489>.ini

For example:

bc. profile_dev01@10.10.10.20_1489.ini

Insert the following content:

bc.. # Background color
frame.bgcolor=#00dd00
# Name of the main window (prefix)
frame.title=INT
# Place where to store default configurations from the scripts
bc. fs.store.dir=fsp_base-dev02
